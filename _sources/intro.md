# Decoding Microbiota: Tutorial on 16S Amplicon Analysis



This tutorial was first designed for teaching the lab members of Dr. Hani El-Nezami from [University of Hong Kong](https://www.hkuelnlab.com/our-team),  and [University of Eastern Finland](https://uefconnect.uef.fi/en/hani.el-nezamy/). As one of the Phd students supervised by Hani, I provided this tutorial to the Phd and Master-Level students to help them doing the 16S Amplicon analysis independently. 



This tutorial will mainly focus on using QIIME2:

1. Basic materials for 16S analysis
2. Upstream analysis (From raw sequencing data to Feature counts matrix and Pathway counts matrix)
3. Downstream analysis (Analysis with proper statistical tools)



This tutorial will do the best to avoid redundancy compared with the official tutorial, while also providing a hands-on guidelines for 16S sequencing. As this tutorial is also open to external visitors, if you have any questions or collaborations regarding this tutorial or microbiota study, please email me with the email below.
